                <p>"Comfort Women" refer to women who were forcibly mobilized and forced to live as sex slaves in brothels called ‘comfort stations’ established by the Japanese military under the pretext of efficiently carrying out war after September 18, 1931, when the Manchurian Incident took place up until when Japan was defeated in the Pacific War in 1945. In literature and testimonies, ‘comfort women’ were referred to as hostesses, special women, prostitutes, geishas, street girls, waitresses, etc. while ‘comfort stations’ were referred to as army recreation facilities, clubs, servicemen centers or Joseon restaurants.<p>

                <p>The term used to refer to the victims who were conscripted by the Japanese military during the Japanese colonial rule and used as sex slaves includes value judgment to a certain extent. Hence, the use of certain terms in discussing the ‘comfort women’ issue is particularly important.</p>

              <p>When the issue of ‘comfort women’ of the Japanese military began surfacing regularly in the early 1990s, the term ‘Chongshindae (voluntarily offered body corps)’ was widely used. Chongshindae literally meant, “a corps which voluntarily sacrifices bodies for the Japanese state (emperor)” and was created by the Japanese to mobilize the labor force. Originally, Chongshindae (mobilization of labor) and ‘wianbu or comfort women’ (mobilization of sex) were fundamentally different. However, the two terms were wrongfully used in place of one another due to instances where women conscripted into the Women’s Volunteer Labor Corps (yeoja geunro chongshindae) were taken as ‘comfort women’. Subsequently, the term, ‘military comfort women’, was established as the official terminology after it was proven through research to be closer to the term used at the time.</p>

              <p>During the 1990s, the term ‘jongun wianbu or jugun ianfu’ was used in Japan. However, the word ‘jongun or jugun’, meaning “war” has the connotation of “following the military” which gave the impression that the women voluntarily followed the military just like war correspondents (jongun gija) or military nurses (jongun ganhosa). It is a term that should be used with caution because it conceals the historical responsibility of Japan which forcibly conscripted ‘comfort women’ for its military.</p>

              <p>When the international community first raised the issue of the Japanese military’s ‘comfort women’, they used the term, ‘comfort women’, which is the literal translation of ‘wianbu’. Currently, the term ‘military sex slavery’ and ‘military sexual slavery’ are mainly used in the international community such as the United Nations. The Radhika Coomaraswamy Report, submitted to the UN Human Rights Commission in 1996, clearly articulated this issue as military sexual slavery during armed conflict.</p>

              <p>The adoption of the term 'military sexual slavery' in the international community was because of the perception that the issue of ‘comfort women’ in the Japanese military could not be explained as voluntary acts of sacrifice by the citizens of a state although it had the characteristics of prostitution which is occurs through contracts created in the private realm.. In other words, the Japanese military ‘comfort women’ denotes that the state mobilized women by force subjecting them to collective sexual violence and placing them in a state where their conditions of life were as ‘slaves’. Thus, the word "comfort women" is a very offender-centric term and harbors the negative effect of hiding the violence and coercion associated with the truth. Considering the recruitment motives, recruitment process, and violence of the Japanese military, the term ‘sexual slavery’ of the Japanese military seems to be more appropriate.</p>

              <p>Currently, Korean society uses the term Japanese military ‘comfort women’ more than the term Japanese military ‘sexual slavery’. Although the term ‘‘comfort women’’ is not suited for revealing the true nature of the problem, it conveys the distinctive atmosphere of the time when the term ‘comfort women’ was coined to institutionalize the system. It also prevents survivors from being hurt psychologically having to call themselves ‘sex slaves’. The law, which was enacted by the Korean government to support victims, uses the term ‘comfort women’ of the Japanese military. Among the researchers, there are some who use the term ‘comfort women’ of the ‘Japanese military’ by separating the words with a single quotation mark to express their disagreement with the term used by the Japanese.</p>

              <dt>Establishment of Japanese ‘Comfort Stations’ and Scale of the Conscription</dt>

                <p>After instigating the Manchurian Incident, Japan continued to expand their invasion front.</p>

              <p>The Japanese military set up ‘comfort stations’ under the pretext of 1) preventing the rape of local women, 2) preventing sexually transmitted diseases through prostitution, and 3) to provide sexual consolation to army soldiers. There is a record which states that an early form of the Japanese military’s ‘comfort station’ was initially established in Shanghai in January of 1932. With the start of Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the number of Japanese ‘comfort stations’ grew rapidly; and, the area from which ‘comfort women’ were conscripted also expanded alongside the expansion of Japanese occupied territories. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the entire process of establishing ‘comfort stations’, managing them, recruiting ‘comfort women’, and transporting them was primarily undertaken by the Japanese military. A system of active cooperation was set up between the Japanese government agencies such as the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the Governor General of Korea and Taiwan.</p>

              <p>At present, it is not possible to know the total number of women conscripted as Japanese military ‘comfort women’ since no systematic data revealing their number. Some scholars have speculated on the total number of ‘comfort women’ victims based on data from Japanese military plans of how many ‘comfort women’ were to be assigned per Japanese soldier or from testimonial records. However, there seems to be a great differences among researchers due to a variety of assertions placing the total number between a range of 30,000 to 400,000.</p>

              <p>In the early days of ‘comfort station’ installations, the Japanese conscripted mainly women from Japan and their colonies of Joseon (Korea) and Taiwan. As the war became prolonged and the front lines expanded, women from other occupied territories such as China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Dutch women living in Indonesia were forced to serve as ‘comfort women’. Yoshimi Yoshiaki, a researcher who has long studied the issue of ‘comfort women’ in the Japanese military, estimated that the number of ‘comfort women’ in the Japanese military was at least 80,000 to 200,000 and that more than half of them were women from Joseon (Korea).</p>

                <p>After instigating the Manchurian Incident, Japan continued to expand their invasion front.</p>

              <p>Korean women were conscripted as ‘comfort women’ by the Japanese military were through methods such as employment fraud, intimidation and violence, human trafficking, and abduction. They were recruited being given false promises for jobs at factories or that they could earn a lot of money. Newspaper ads were used to recruit "comfort women", but detailed information on the type of work they would be doing was never clearly mentioned. Also, considering the rate of newspaper subscriptions by women and the rate of female literacy at that time, there seemed to be few cases in which recruitment advertisements were delivered directly to women. The Japanese military authorities selected a contractor to manage the ‘comfort stations’, while the Japanese military and police cooperated in the recruitment process. The contractors approached women through recruiters or approached them directly. They also attracted women with job opportunities or offering means to make money, mobilized them through coercion and violence, or even resorted kidnapping at times. The national mobilization system and the rationale that ‘comfort women’ were necessary to carry out war allowed such physical violence. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War on 1941, ‘Certificates of Passage’ were issued to move comfort facilities overseas. Processing of the women were carried out by recruiters who received cooperation from public authorities. During this process, there were falsification of family register records. After the Pacific War began, ‘military travel documents’ were used to move these facilities overseas. Recruiters or transporters held onto these ‘military travel documents’ and were provided all sorts of convenience by the Japanese army during the transfer.</p>
