                <p>We have named this webzine ‘KYEOL’ to signal our intent to delve into and unravel a complex layer of intertwined issues – surrounding the military sexual slavery, such as colonial rule, armed conflict, sexual violence and human rights.</p>

                <p>This webzine will provide an update on the research and activities of experts, who investigate the sexual slavery issue from the different perspectives of history, politics, literature, diplomacy, culture and the female rights movement. It also seeks to promote a new language for discussion based on in-depth analyses, and deliver the content in various formats, including document reviews and narrative accounts. In doing so, it intends to make the content more accessible to the general public. </p>

                <p>The "Comfort Women" issue is one which many people might think they understand, yet would find it difficult to clarify when prompted. Indeed, only a careful unravelling of the intricate weave of events will achieve a greater understanding of the issue and enable us to construct a history which continues to haunt our lives in the present day.<p>

                <p>KYEOL intends to lay the foundations for achieving a fuller understanding of the complex "Comfort Women" issue. This objective will highlight three approaches: ‘understanding the complexity of the issue’, ‘applying academic rigour’, and ‘bringing personal empathy to the subject’. Indeed, these are the core principles of this webzine.</p>
