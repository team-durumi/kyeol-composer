                <p>The Research Institute on Japanese Military Sexual Slavery (RIMSS) was launched in August 2018 under the Women's Human Rights Institute of Korea (WHRIK) to conduct systematic investigations and research on the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” issue and deliver education and promotion aimed at enhancing the public’s understanding on the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” issue.</p>

                <p>RIMSS, through conducting continuous investigations and research on the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” issue, intends to provide relevant data by collecting and organizing them in order to publicize the conditions of the operations of the comfort stations and offer easy access to the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” issue. Furthermore, RIMSS hopes to contribute to the improvement of awareness on the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” issue, the enhancement of women's rights, and the spread of consciousness for peace through providing education and promotion regarding this issue.</p>
